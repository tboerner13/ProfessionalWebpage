04/15/25: Created initial repository with folder structure as instructed. Created vite@latest for vanilla js. Installed express, mongoose, ejs, dotenv, tailwindcss, @tailwindcss/vite, nodemon, and cors. Configured Tailwindcss  in src/tailwind.config.js and server setup in server.js. Followed a basic outline template to fill out most of the files.

04/26/25: Tailwind was not working, so I had to try to reconfigure everything. Ultimately needed to uninstall @tailwindcss/vite, vite, and then install tailwind, @tailwindcss/cli, postcss, and autoprefixer and rework the configuration files to fit properly. I also installed concurrently to be able to run the server and update the css at the same time.

05/01/25: Set up Database data in MongoDB, added styles for each bit of information being added through the database connection. I tried to style it by myself at first, but I used chatgpt to clean it up a little better than I could, and I think it looks really nice.
